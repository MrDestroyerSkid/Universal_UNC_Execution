# Universal UNC Execution
UNC also known as Unified Naming Convention execution for executor brand
Universal UNC Execution is a "script" enviroment to launch the vanilla enviroment of unified scripting API, which make scripters code more easily on their brand executor
# How can it work for you?
If you didn't heard of UNC, go to this web https://scriptunc.org for further detail of explanation

NOTE: I'm not a creator of UNC or any involvement of it.

UNC is a vanilla enviroment for executors, most of these day scripting are quite hard with much more brand that has their convention, result of script developer have more diffcult time. We all know script executors are just for building script, which is why UNC enviroment are necessary

But let's get to the reaason why we making this.

Let's say you're using KRNL, a free good executor, but can't run a script that is guarantee can run KRNL because there's a required enviroment. You tried so many times to run that script but turns to be failed, but why?

Reason of this, is because of the script only SUPPORTS vanilla environment and doees not know if that's inside a library or not.

Now, this script will adds more functions and environment for a stable vanilla uses, helping you developing without using the library name. (Note: The original executor environment functions will not be removed or either be modified.)

# How to use it?

In order to do so you'll try and search for your executor name from the files, please paste the UNC execution into your executor in the first line, put your script in bottom of the UNC just so is it working, this will adds.

There's also a fixed and working UNC Environment check at https://github.com/MrDestroyerSkid/Universal_UNC_Execution/blob/main/UNCCheckEnv.lua or search for UNCCheckEnv in the section
